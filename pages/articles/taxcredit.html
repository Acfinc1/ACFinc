  <h2 class="article-title"><u>Introduction to Personal Tax Credit</u></h2>

  <p>
    Taxation in Canada is built on laws, formulas, and logical reasoning. The Income Tax Act provides both the principles and formulas. Incorrect tax filings can lead to serious penalties, so only qualified professionals should offer tax advice or process tax returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Canadian taxpayers are categorized as individuals or corporations. Corporations file taxes using the T2 form; individuals—including sole proprietors or partnerships—use the T1 form. Trusts are taxed under specific rules using different forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide familiarizes Scarborough residents with personal tax credits, which reduce tax payable based on personal circumstances. Non-refundable credits must be used in the year claimed, though some can be carried forward.
  </p>

  <p>Each personal tax credit consists of four elements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Eligibility – Who qualifies.</li>
    <li>Base Amount – Dollar value used to calculate the credit.</li>
    <li>Rate – Percentage applied to the base amount.</li>
    <li>Formula – How the final credit is calculated.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    The base amount and rate may change yearly, reflecting fiscal strategies aimed at improving Canada's economic health.
