  <center><b><u><font size="5">Introduction to Personal Tax Credit</font></u></b></center>

  <p>
  Taxation in Canada is build on laws, formulas, and logical reasoning. The Income Tax Act is the legal foundation providing both the principles and formulas. Reasoning and deductions are not enough to process tax return for an individual without knowledge of the laws. It's important to note that assumptions or incorrect tax filings can lead to serious penalties—making it clear that only qualified professionals should offer tax advice or process tax returns.
  </p>
  <p>
  Canadian taxpayers in context are of two categories: individuals and corporations. A corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity. Corporations file their taxes using the T2 form, whereas individuals—including those operating as sole proprietors or in partnerships—file their taxes using the T1 form. Trusts, which are unique legal arrangements, use a different form and are taxed under specific rules.

      A corporation is recognized as a separate legal entity, often treated as an individual for tax purposes. Corporations file their taxes using the T2 form, whereas individuals—including those operating as sole proprietors or in partnerships—file their taxes using the T1 form. Trusts, which are unique legal arrangements, use a different form and are taxed under specific rules.

  We have prepared this infomercial to familiarize Scarborough residence with personal tax credits—a key component of the Canadian tax system. These credits reduce the amount of tax you owe based on your personal situation, but they will not generate a refund if your credits exceed your tax payable. Non-refundable credits must be used in the year they are claimed, although some can be carried forward to future years. </p>
  <p>Each personal tax credit consists of four elements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Eligibility - Determines who is eligible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Base Amount - The dollar value used to calculate the credit.
    </Li>
    <li>
      Rate - A percentage applied to the base amount to calculate the actual credit.
    </li>
  <li>
    Formula - Used to derive the final credit applied to your tax payable.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The base amount and the rate may change from year to year, depending on government policy and economic goals. Economists pay close attention to these variables, as they reflect fiscal strategies aimed at improving Canada's economic health.
