<b><u><font size="5"><center> Supporting small businesses in the age of E-Commerce Challenges</center></font></b></u>
<p>
The strategy of e-commerce is profit maximization and cost minimization. 
The minimal increase in fuel prices and the increasing desire to travel 
have yet to significantly boost the profitability of small businesses.
<br><br>
While the pandemic-induced price hikes have stagnated, 
  consumer spending has not seen a proportional increase. 
  Large corporations, with their substantial profit margins and financial reserves, 
  can offer discounts to further minimize competition, 
  making it difficult for small businesses to thrive.
<br><br>
These companies enjoy the ability to purchase goods in large quantities at a discount 
  and offer goods to consumers at a cheaper price than the market. 
  Also, can change the market dynamics.  
<br><br>
  Whilst, small businesses are also grappling with operating challenges, 
  such as maintaining an online presence and fulfilling the growing demand 
  for services like delivery and virtual shelves. 
  <br><br>
  Businesses create strategies to attract consumers. 
  They can use higher quality products, products which are different in the market, 
  or products available for the cheapest price. 
<br><br>
Businesses that offer higher quality goods and unique products have a share of the market that is dedicated to them. 
  They can decide on the price they offer for their product because the customer is loyal to them.
<br><br>
However, small businesses have accessible market information and have the opportunity of working with competition.
Whereas consumers are overcrowded with information and are finding it more difficult to access the correct information. 
  At the same time, they are being misled because of their dependence on search engines 
  which are designed based on search engine optimization and marketing, but not the product itself. 
<br><br>
The companies that benefit from these marketing strategies are companies that offer low quality products for cheap prices. 
  These marketing strategies are cheap and easier to implement than to invest in capital or acquire better materials. 
<br><br>
The small businesses can push large corporations to shut down whom used to enjoy the benefit of economies of scale and consumers used to enjoy cheaper products. 
  Small businesses can pick the prices for the consumers and consumers must accept the price because there are no other options available. 
<br><br>
When this scenario starts to take place and small businesses start to work together to create a monopoly, 
  then it creates opportunities for large corporations to offer lower prices using economics of scale and become the only supplier. 
<br><br>
This ineffective strategy of producing low quality goods or overpricing goods and then using marketing strategy to attract consumer is wasting resources.
There are very few repair shops and consumers will buy a new product than use an old one. These low-quality products are not durable and are changed over the seasons. Proft is the incentive in investment and waste is minimized. One of the beauties of the free market. 
<br><br>
So, what is investment and how should one invest?
An economics teacher will tell you the strategy is to buy for cheap and sell for more. That is how to make money.
<br><br>
There are two strategies to consider.
Buy a product which will not put constraint on the consumer budget and sell it to a thousand customers or buy a high-ticket expensive product and sell it to ten customers. 
  For example, a house, or investment in shares, or a luxury car.
However, I think it is unwise and rebellious to obtain funds from so many individuals through a business and then give it to one individual for a luxury car. 
<br><br>
 This is similar to lottery. 
For some lottery is picking a few numbers but there is a monetary policy behind lottery. That is to gather and obtain resource from members of the community and transferring it to one individual in the community to invest. This is an efficient and effective method of collecting one dollar from each person and then providing a large pool of fund for a big investment.
<br><br>
The wise investment list depends on preference. 
My top three picks of investments are: real estate, investment in equity, and investment in natural energy and minerals.
<br><br>
Real estate is more complicated than it seems because no one will pay for a fistful of dirt. However, dirt at the right place and at right quantity is valuable. Also, land value appreciates, but some has a ceiling, whereas building value depreciates. 
You might invest in an apartment building, but you might have to renew your mortgage to fix the building and never end up mortgage free. 
<br><br>
Investment in equity is also difficult, but it is very well known that some companies have a strong foundation, and the share prices will not take an extreme fall. 
<br><br>
Third is well established energy and mineral companies, and they have always been the most expensive, but cushioned investment. 
<br><br>
Before investing, you should reconsider your objectives. Analyze other large investors in these companies and that will tell you about the company itself and its future. Also, you must understand the tax consequences before investing.
