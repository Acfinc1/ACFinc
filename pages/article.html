<b><u><font size="5"><center> Supporting small businesses in the age of E-Commerce Challenges</center></font></b></u>
<p>
The strategy of e-commerce is profit maximization and cost minimization. 
  The minimal increase in fuel prices and the increasing desire to travel have yet to significantly boost the profitability of small businesses.
<br><br>
While the pandemic-induced price hikes have stagnated, consumer spending has not seen a proportional increase. Large businesses, with their substantial profit margins and financial reserves, can offer discounts to further minimize competition, making it difficult for small businesses to thrive.
<br><br>
These businesses enjoy the ability to purchase goods in large quantities at a discount and offer goods to consumers at a cheaper price than the market. Also, can change the market dynamics. 
<br><br>
Whilst, small businesses are grappling with operating challenges, such as maintaining an online presence and fulfilling the growing demand for services like delivery and virtual shelves. 
<br><br>
Entrepreneurs are taught to create strategies to attract consumers. Sell top quality goods, goods which are different in the market, or goods available for the cheapest prices. 
<br><br>
Businesses with top quality goods and unique goods qualify for a share of the market that is dedicated to them. Businesses can set prices for their goods because the customer is loyal to them.
<br><br>
Also, businesses have accessible market information and have the opportunity of working with competition to create a virtual monopoly. Whereas consumers are overcrowded with information and are faced with challenges to access the correct information. At the same time, they are being misled because of their dependence on search engines which are designed based on search engine optimization, algorithms, and marketing, but not based on the quality of the goods. 
<br><br>
Businesses that benefit from these marketing strategies offer low quality goods for cheaper prices. These marketing strategies are cheaper and easier to implement than to invest in capital or acquire better raw materials. 
<br><br>
This strategy can push large businesses to shut down whom had economies of scale and consumers could purchase goods from them. In a monopoly, small businesses can set the prices for the consumers and consumers must accept the price because there are no other options available. 
<br><br>
However, when this scenario starts to take place and small businesses start to work together to create a monopoly, then it creates opportunities for large businesses to offer lower prices using economics of scale and become the only supplier. 
<br><br>
This ineffective strategy of producing low quality goods or overpricing goods and then using marketing strategy to attract consumer is wasting resources. When waste is minimized to increase profit in a profit incentive environment then it is an effective and efficient use of resources. One of the beauties of the free market. 
<br><br>
So, what is investment and how should we invest?  You can earn a business income by buying goods for cheap and selling for more.
<br><br>
There are two strategies to consider. Buy goods for resale which will not put constrain on the consumer budget and sell it to a thousand consumers or buy a high-ticket expensive good and sell it to ten consumers. For example, a house, or investment in shares, or a luxury car. 
<br><br>
However, for an investor this strategy is not effective when investor obtains fund from consumers and then rolls it over to one business for a depreciable asset.  
<br><br>
This is like lottery. Lottery is not only picking a few numbers, but there is a monetary policy behind lottery. That is to gather and obtain resource from members of the community and transferring it to one individual in the community to invest. This is an efficient and effective method of collecting a little amount from everyone and then providing a large pool of fund for a big investment.
<br><br>
The wise investment list depends on preference. My top three picks of investments are: real estate, investment in equity, and investment in natural energy and minerals.
<br><br>
Real estate is complicated because no one will pay for a fistful of dirt. However, dirt at the right place, right time, and at the right quantity is valuable. Also, land value appreciates, but some has a ceiling, whereas building value depreciates. An investor might invest in an apartment building but might have to renew his/her mortgage to fix the building and never end up mortgage free. 
<br><br>
Investment in equity is complicated, but it is very well known that some companies have a strong foundation, and the share prices will not take an extreme fall. 
<br><br>
Third is well established energy and mineral companies, and they have always been the most expensive, but cushioned investment. 
<br><br>
Before investing, you should reconsider your objectives. Analyze other large investors in these companies, and that will tell you about the company itself and its future. Also, you must understand the tax consequences before investing. Advise from a certified investment advisor and a tax advisor is very important.
