<b><u><font size="5"><center> Supporting small businesses in the age of E-Commerce Challenges.</center></font></b></u>
<p>
The strategy of E-commerce has always been to capture hundred percent of the market. 
The minimal increase in fuel prices and the increasing desire to travel have yet to significantly boost the profitability of small businesses.
<br><br>
While the pandemic-induced price hikes have stagnated, consumer spending has not seen a proportional increase.
Large corporations, with their substantial profit margins and financial reserves, have the ability to offer discounts to further minimize competition, making it difficult for small businesses to thrive.
<br><br>
Whilst, small businesses are also grappling with operation challenges, such as maintaining an online presence and fulfilling the growing demand for digital services like delivery and virtual shelves. 
<br><br>
Understanding the need to keep the competition and supply options available, we have rolled up our sleeves to help small businesses.
